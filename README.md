## About the organization:

All Parks Alliance for Change is an organization for manufactured home parks residents. Its goal is to improve the quality of life in park neighborhoods, protect the rights of park residents, and advance public policy change that supports safe, affordable, and stable park communities.

## The problem we try to solve:

### Common questions are asked quite often
- Asking experienced neighbors reduce work for officers
Easier and quicker to get answer instead of calling the office

### People donâ€™t know how to social with neighbors in the community 
- Provide a platform for people in the community to join interest group, and help each other

### Age of users varies and elder people are not familiar with using APP
- Can be used by both younger who prefer using account and elder people who can interact without having an account.
